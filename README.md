*As your make your trip back from Mars back to your home planet Earth, you are intercepted by pirates. They know you are carrying precious metals from Mars, and they want all of it for themselves. In order to guarantee an eventual victory, they warp space around you creating a prison in space. There is no escape, at this point the best you can do is cause the most damage to their fleet to prevent them from doing it again to future travellers. Good luck.*
